Assumptions

- The solution should be case-insensitive.
- A "word" is a sequence of alphanumeric characters. Punctuation should be filtered out.

How to run:
- Open the root directory in terminal.
- Run `javac src/main/java/WordCount.java`
- Run `java src/main/java/WordCount.java <your_file>`

Your file should be in `    the root directory, just like test.txt.

So for test.txt you would run:
`java src/main/java/WordCount.java test.txt`
